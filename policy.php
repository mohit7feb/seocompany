            <h3>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We will keep your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in
                this Privacy Policy, or as required by law (e.g., for tax, legal, accounting, etc.).</p>

                <h3>How We Protect And Store Your Information</h3>
              <p>We are committed to making sure your privacy is protected when you use our Website and when we collect information from you. We take the security of your information seriously, and implement a variety of security measures to maintain safety of all Personal Information you provide. We also make sure that third parties we use to process your Personal  Information also use appropriate security measures to protect your data.</p>
              <p>When we collect sensitive information like your credit card information, social security numbers, financials, etc., that information is encrypted and securely transmitted. For example, we use a secure server for transmitting sensitive information. All supplied sensitive/credit card information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. You can verify that this sensitive information is being transmitted securely by looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the webpage.</p>
              <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. We urge you to be careful about entering information on public computers or on public networks.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted to or stored on our Website.</p>
              <h3>Do Not Track (DNT) Signals</h3>
              <p>We have access only to or collect information that you provide us through your use of the Website, and may work with third parties to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which attempt to recognize you across multiple devices. Although we do our best to honor your privacy preferences, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser.</p>
              <h3>Cookies</h3>
              <p>Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser. Cookies enable websites or service providers’ systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For example, you may use our cookies to stay logged in when you exit a browser window.</p>
              <h3>Disclosure to Third Parties</h3>
              <p>We may sell, trade, share, or otherwise transfer your Personal Information with our affiliates, as well as with trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Website, conducting our business and servicing you, including, but not limited to, providers of hosting, cloud services and other information technology services providers for the management or hosting of the Website; payment processors; order and subscription management and fulfillment services; e-commerce platforms; rating and reviews platforms; email communication and customer support services; and web analytics, marketing and digital advertising services, so long as those parties agree not to use the information for their direct marketing purpose, to keep this information confidential, and use appropriate security measures to protect your data. We may also share, sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information (excluding credit card information) to third parties who do not assist us with operating our Website or conducting our business, for the third party’s direct marketing purposes. We may also disclose your information as required under applicable law, to enforce our Website policies, or to protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety. Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, or sale or transfer of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be transferred to a successor or affiliate or other entity surviving out of the event.</p>

You are responsible for periodically visiting our Website and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.</p>
              <h3>Contact Us</h3>
